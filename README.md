A Rust library for various functions helping in 64bit usize mathematical operations.

This library is inspired while solving projecteuler.net problems. You may find the functions of this library useful for those problems.

To add this to your Rust project, include in dependencies:
```
eratosthenes = { git = "https://github.com/haz0110/eratosthenes" }
```

Calculates:
-   primes(), nth_prime(), is_prime().
-   fibonacci(), nth_fibonacci().
-   geometric_sequence() where a * r ^ (n - 1).
-   is_palindrome()
-   sum(), sum_even(), sum_odd()
